Try React
Try React online or set up your local development environment.

Online
If you’re just interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen or CodeSandbox.

Minimal HTML Template
If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so don’t use it in production.

These setups are designed to get you up and running with a great developer experience and are ready for production. They include linting, testing, and optimizations built-in; however, they require more time and disk space to set up and install.
